      <p class="discover">
        Let's discover the best in beauty , together.
      </p>
      <p> A sugar scrub is a kind of face scrub formulated with sugar that you can use to exfoliate your skin. Our L’Oréal Paris Pure-Sugar Scrub line features four face scrubs that are formulated with three types of sugar to gently yet effectively exfoliate the surface of skin—on your face and on your lips.
       <br> A facial cleanser creates a foamy lather when you apply it. These cleansers tend to intensely cleanse and purify your skin by removing the buildup of oil, makeup, and other impurities that accumulates throughout the day. While foaming face wash can be used by anyone, they’re often recommended for those with oily or acne-prone skin due to their thorough cleansing properties. Still, some foam cleansers, like our best L’Oréal foam cleanser are actually meant for all skin types!</p>
