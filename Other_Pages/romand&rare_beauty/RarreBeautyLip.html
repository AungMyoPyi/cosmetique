        Swipe over bare lips, adding layers as desired. At first application, it feels a bit more viscous and more similar to a slick gloss, but eventually the formula begins to dry and transform into lip tint.
        Store the product at room temperature, away from direct sunlight, heat, and humidity. Ensure that the cap is tightly closed after each use to prevent the product from drying out.
