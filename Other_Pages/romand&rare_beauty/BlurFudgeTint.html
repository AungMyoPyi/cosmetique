      <p>
        The Romand Blur Fudge Tint is a gorgeous lip tint available in 11 long-lasting matte colors. The special formula is made to achieve the beautiful gradient lip effect, leaving a blurry finish on your lips. Wax ensures smooth application and makes the tint easily blendable to achieve the finish you want. The pigmented colors look beautiful with a thin layer on as well as a thick, more intense layer of the lip tint. The smooth formula prevents the tint from settling in the cracks of your lips and ensures a long-lasting finish.
